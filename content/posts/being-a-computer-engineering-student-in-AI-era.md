# Introduction 

Hi, readers. This blog is my first try, so I am a little excited. I want to talk about AI and its side effects because I think Computer
Engineering or Computer Science students like me, are bored of this topic. Every day we see a new AI news saying "Computer Engineering or
Science is over" and a fake conversation about it.  

I've been thinking about it for a while, and maybe I found an option for us: a life-partner (Please don't think of marrying an AI, that time hasn't come yet!). Anyway, if we incorporate the memory of AI with human thinking, then I suppose we will not cease. Maybe, you will ask me: "If
that happens, will Earth become like in Detroit:Become Human?" 
I understand you but I don't think so. Humanity is unpredictable;
Of course it might come true before we know it, but the probability is very low.

Succinctly, this is not a competition between AI and Humanity; it is a new lifeform in a new world. And herald of the new world.
